Alright, this is how things go down.

- if statements:

if(...) {

}
else {

}

- for statements:

for(int i = 0; i < butts; i++) {

}

- function declarations:

void function(type arg, type arg2, etc...) {

}

- 4 spaces.
- Important objects get their own file

Do NOT submit code that compiles with warnings.

- Casts:

(type ) variablename

type INCLUDES any pointer symbols.

If you are unsure about something, ask in an issue.
